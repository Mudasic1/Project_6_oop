# Python Object-Oriented Programming Assignments
### This repository contains solutions to 21 Python assignments focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Each assignment demonstrates a specific OOP feature or technique, implemented in Python.
#### Assignments Overview

* Using self: A Student class with name and marks attributes, initialized using self in a constructor, and a display() method to print details.
* Using cls: A Counter class that tracks object creation using a class variable and a class method with cls to display the count.
* Public Variables and Methods: A Car class with a public brand variable and a start() method, accessible from outside the class.
* Class Variables and Class Methods: A Bank class with a class variable bank_name and a class method change_bank_name(cls, name) to modify it, affecting all instances.
* Static Variables and Static Methods: A MathUtils class with a static method add(a, b) that returns the sum of two numbers.
* Constructors and Destructors: A Logger class that prints messages during object creation (constructor) and destruction (destructor).
* Access Modifiers: An Employee class with public (name), protected (_salary), and private (__ssn) variables, demonstrating access behavior.
* The super() Function: A Teacher class inheriting from Person, using super() to call the base class constructor and adding a subject field.
* Abstract Classes and Methods: An abstract Shape class with an abstract area() method, implemented by a Rectangle subclass.
* Instance Methods: A Dog class with name and breed instance variables and a bark() method that includes the dog's name.
* Class Methods: A Book class with a class variable total_books and a class method increment_book_count() to track book additions.
* Static Methods: A TemperatureConverter class with a static method celsius_to_fahrenheit(c) to convert temperatures.
* Composition: A Car class that uses composition by incorporating an Engine object, accessing an Engine method via the Car class.
* Aggregation: A Department class that aggregates an independently created Employee object.
* Method Resolution Order (MRO) and Diamond Inheritance: Classes A, B, C, and D demonstrating MRO in a diamond inheritance structure.
* Function Decorators: A log_function_call decorator that logs function execution, applied to a say_hello() function.
* Class Decorators: A class decorator add_greeting that adds a greet() method to a Person class.
* Property Decorators: A Product class with a private _price attribute, managed using @property, @setter, and @deleter.
callable() and call(): A Multiplier class with a __call__() method to multiply inputs by a factor, tested with callable().
